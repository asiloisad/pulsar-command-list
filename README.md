Fork of [command-palette](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/tree/master/packages/command-palette). Screenshot uses [one-day-ui](https://github.com/asiloisad/pulsar-one-day-ui) and [one-day-syntax](https://github.com/asiloisad/pulsar-one-day-syntax) themes.

## Features

- **Recent commands**: Recently used commands appear at the top when no filter is applied.
- **Fuzzy search**: Search across command names, descriptions, and tags.
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Shows keybindings for each command.
